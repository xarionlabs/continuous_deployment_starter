# Since we're using python:3.9-slim instead of apache/airflow image,
# we need to install Airflow and its dependencies for DAG testing

# Core Airflow with extras for PostgreSQL, Celery, and Redis
apache-airflow[postgres,celery,redis]==3.0.2

# Standard operators provider
apache-airflow-providers-standard

# Additional packages needed by DAGs:
psycopg2-binary # For PostgreSQL connection to the APP DB
ShopifyAPI>=11.0.0 # Official Shopify Python library
pandas # For data handling and date parsing assistance in DAGs
requests # General HTTP requests, if needed by DAGs directly
