# Base Airflow (apache/airflow:3.0.2) already includes postgres, celery, redis extras.
# List only ADDITIONAL Python packages needed by your DAGs or plugins,
# or if you need to override a version that comes with the base image.

# For DAGs:
psycopg2-binary # For PostgreSQL connection to the APP DB. Airflow itself uses its own.
ShopifyAPI>=11.0.0 # Official Shopify Python library
pandas # For data handling and date parsing assistance in DAGs
requests # General HTTP requests, if needed by DAGs directly

# Example of pinning versions for reproducibility:
# psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
# ShopifyAPI==11.0.1
# pandas==2.0.3
# requests==2.31.0

# If you were NOT using an official Airflow image that includes extras, you'd need:
# apache-airflow[postgres,celery,redis]==3.0.2
